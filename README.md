### Mechatronic engineer ⚙️
### IT Student 💻
### Microcontroller Programming 🍇

I am deeply passionate about the world of microcontrollers, embedded systems and the power of open-source Technology. With a keen interest in programming and hardware integration, I thrive on exploring the versatility and capabilities of microcontrollers to create innovative solutions. Whether it's designing custom circuits, developing software for real-time applications, or integrating hardware with software.

IT in general fascinates me, from networking and cybersecurity to troubleshooting complex systems.

Currently I'm working on a Youtube Channel to explain various topics as: Linux Systems, Programming on Microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pi Pico, TIVA TMC1294NCPDT and Arduino.
